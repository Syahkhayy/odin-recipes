# odin-recipes
The first web programming project on Odin Project

Creator: Syahmi Khairul

PROJECTS: SIMPLE RECIPE WEBPAGES

This project was developed to help me use my knowledge that i have learnt in Odin Project. I will build a simple main page that will link to other pages that provide that particular recipe.

For beginning, i will be using only HTML to make the body of the pages. Later on i will revisit this project with CSS and Javascript knowledge.

SKILLS: HTML (CSS and Javascript)

(This README will be updated when there is any changes)
